And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme.

907,5713.json,barely-true,woman account percent job lost obama,"corrections-and-updates,jobs,women",Mitt Romney,Former governor,Massachusetts,republican,34,32,58,33,19,Mitt Romney's website,"Romney's website said that women account for 92. 3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against womens job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92. 3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. ""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline . . . has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions. ""This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40. 5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Womens Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington Universitys public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E.  Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""theres a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. ""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector. ""That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the presidents stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. ""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92. 3 percent figure as a measure of Obamas record on women was ""dubious at best. ""First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers? ""And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama. """"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr.  Bush nor Mr.  Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. Well conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said its fair to fault Obama for that. ""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I dont give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery.

UPDATE, Feb.  29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col.  Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents ""were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins. ""In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T.  Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj.  Gen.  J.  Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics. ""When we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion.",Donald Trump,3.16,Donald Trump Donald Trump Jr. Family of Donald Trump Presidency of Donald Trump Ivana Trump Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign Racial views of Donald Trump Political positions of Donald Trump Wealth of Donald Trump Impeachment of Donald Trump Indictments against Donald Trump Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal False or misleading statements by Donald Trump Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump Second impeachment of Donald Trump Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Inauguration of Donald Trump Ivanka Trump,-0.18100063428282737

Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined. Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy. As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale. Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session. Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, ""once he sold the home . . . the speaker's position on the issue changed. ""We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud.
