""While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said hes opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb.  22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms. ""To Pizer, these carbon limits dont fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe youd call it the same family, but its different because youre telling each source, heres what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs. This idea of trying to limit businesses exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade. ""We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romneys administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade. ""But he added, ""its in the eye of the beholder. ""We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact.",,4.037735849056603,,-0.09616243317723275

Budget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming hes clear about what hes doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isnt in the budget resolution passed by the House. The president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget  that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013.
